# 60DaysOfML

For the last couple of months I have been reading about materials in Machine learning. While learning, I realized I was going back to old contents that I have already learnt and understood time and again to revise. While, it was good way, I think I will benefit more if I just write what I understood on the day I learn anything on ML so when I revise, I can recall first what I had understood and look for anything I missed.

Any new topic or old topic that I revise any day for the next 60 days, I will document it in this repo. 

For this project, I am following Deep Learning Specialization Course on Coursera by Andrew Ng.
Any code related to this project will be under code folder.

### Day 1
Deep learning Specialization Course 1: 
Neural Networks

Basic introduction to neural network. As the computational power and size of data grew, it helped the growth of neural network. Traditional ML techniques efficiency usually stopped getting better after certain size of dataset.

There was a question, **does neural network needs many features**?  
=> More features works better if the features are not engineered from existing. Or else, neural network can itself find the hidden relation, we dont need to explicitly feature engineer like for traditional approaches.
