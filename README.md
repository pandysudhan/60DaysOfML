# 60DaysOfML

For the last couple of months I have been reading about materials in Machine learning. While learning, I realized I was going back to old contents that I have already learnt and understood time and again to revise. While, it was good way, I think I will benefit more if I just write what I understood on the day I learn anything on ML so when I revise, I can recall first what I had understood and look for anything I missed.

Any new topic or old topic that I revise any day for the next 60 days, I will document it in this repo. 

For this project, I am following Deep Learning Specialization Course on Coursera by Andrew Ng.
Any code related to this project will be under code folder.
